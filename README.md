# conceptquiz

This is an educational project. With the sole purpose of learning by doing, I start this type of quiz to learn concepts commonly used in computing, programming and systems engineering. 

I am taking Python online course and need to familiarize myself with these terms. 

I'm getting a great guide from GEMINI, although most of the time it offers snippets of code that doesn't work, but it gives me a good example of the syntax and built-in functions that can be used. 

I must say that I am using PySimpleGUI with the license type: No-Cost, for personal and non-commercial purposes.

About using the listed files:

diciconariodepruebas.py is a dictionary with only 3 elements to hold the test, whereas DICTIO_coding_concepts_eduardo is the real deal.
